# üåßÔ∏è Rainfall Prediction Classifier

This project is a machine learning-based classifier that predicts whether it will rain tomorrow, using historical weather data. It applies models such as **Logistic Regression** and **Random Forest Classifier**, performing **EDA**, **feature engineering**, and **model evaluation** to build an accurate prediction system.

##  Project Highlights

-  **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Visualizations & insights on weather trends.
-  **Data Preprocessing**: Handling missing values, encoding categorical variables.
-  **Machine Learning Models**: Logistic Regression, Random Forest Classifier.
-  **Evaluation Metrics**: Accuracy, Confusion Matrix, and True Positive Rate.
-  **Best Performing Model**: Random Forest Classifier with higher TPR and accuracy.

## üìÅ Dataset

- **Source**: [Australian Rainfall Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/jsphyg/weather-dataset-rattle-package)
- **Attributes**: Temperature, humidity, wind direction/speed, evaporation, etc.
- **Target**: `RainTomorrow` ‚Äì Yes or No

##  Tech Stack

- Python
- NumPy, Pandas
- Matplotlib, Seaborn
- Scikit-learn
- Jupyter Notebook

---

##  Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

- Correlation matrix to identify key predictors
- Distribution plots of rainfall, temperature, and humidity
- Missing value heatmaps and feature importance graphs

##  Model Building

| Model                | Accuracy | True Positive Rate |
|---------------------|----------|--------------------|
| Logistic Regression | 84%      | 51%                |
| Random Forest       | 83%      | 50% ‚úÖ              |

üëâ *Random Forest performed better due to its robustness with non-linear relationships and higher ability to handle noise.*

---

##  Key Takeaways

- **Humidity at 9am**, **Evaporation**, and **WindGustDir** were found less efficient in predicting rainfall.
- Random Forest outperformed Logistic Regression in both accuracy and true positive rate.
- Real-world application in **agriculture**, **weather reporting**, and **disaster prevention systems**.

##  Future Improvements

- Hyperparameter tuning for improved performance
- Feature selection using SHAP or recursive elimination
- Deploying using Flask/Streamlit for real-time predictions
